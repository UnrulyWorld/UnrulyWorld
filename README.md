## Hello fellas

I'm Dim, a passionate student in neuroscience, physics, and applied mathematics, currently exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, control systems, and financial modeling.  
ðŸ”¬ I enjoy building smart agents, crafting predictive models, and experimenting with deep learning architectures â€” from CNNs and LSTMs to reinforcement learning algorithms like PPO and DreamerV3.  

Feel free to check out my projects and connect if you share similar interests!
